48,,Some respondents may choose to provide very specific ethnic origins in the National Household Survey (NHS) while other respondents may choose to give more general responses. This means that two respondents with the same ethnic ancestry could have different response patterns and thus could be counted as having different ethnic origins. For example one respondent may report 'East Indian' ethnic origin while another respondent with a similar ancestral background may report 'Punjabi' or 'South Asian' origins; one respondent may report 'Black' while another similar respondent may report 'Ghanaian' or 'African.' As a result ethnic origin data are very fluid and counts for certain origins such as 'East Indian' and 'Black' may seem lower than initially expected. Users who wish to obtain broader response counts may wish to combine data for one or more ethnic origins together or use counts for ethnic categories such as 'South Asian origins' or 'African origins.' (Please note however that 'African origins' should not be considered equivalent to the 'Black' population group or visible minority status as there are persons reporting African origins who report a population group or visible minority status other than 'Black.' Conversely many people report a population group or visible minority status of 'Black' and do not report having 'African' origins. For information on population group and visible minority population in the 2011 NHS refer to the appropriate definitions in this publication.),,,,,,,,
49,,Includes general responses indicating Other African origins (e.g. 'African') as well as more specific responses indicating Other African origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Saharan').,,,,,,,,
50,,Includes general responses indicating West Asian Central Asian and Middle Eastern origins (e.g. 'West Asian' 'Middle Eastern') as well as more specific responses indicating West Asian Central Asian and Middle Eastern origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Baloch' 'Circassian').,,,,,,,,
51,,Includes general responses indicating South Asian origins (e.g. 'South Asian') as well as more specific responses indicating South Asian origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Bhutanese').,,,,,,,,

54,,Includes general responses indicating Pacific Islands origins (e.g. 'Pacific Islander') as well as more specific responses indicating Pacific Islands origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Tahitian').,,,,,,,,
55,,Religion refers to the person's self-identification as having a connection or affiliation with any religious denomination group body sect cult or other religiously defined community or system of belief. Religion is not limited to formal membership in a religious organization or group. Persons without a religious connection or affiliation can self-identify as atheist agnostic or humanist or can provide another applicable response.,,,,,,,,
56,,'Aboriginal identity' includes persons who reported being an Aboriginal person that is First Nations (North American Indian) Métis or Inuk (Inuit) and/or those who reported Registered or Treaty Indian status that is registered under the Indian Act of Canada and/or those who reported membership in a First Nation or Indian band. Aboriginal peoples of Canada are defined in the Constitution Act 1982 section 35 (2) as including the Indian Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.,,,,,,,,
57,,Users should be aware that the estimates associated with this variable are more affected than most by the incomplete enumeration of certain Indian reserves and Indian settlements in the National Household Survey (NHS). In 2011 there were a total of 36 Indian reserves and Indian settlements that were 'incompletely enumerated' in the NHS. For these reserves or settlements NHS enumeration was either not permitted or was interrupted before it could be completed or was not possible because of natural events (specifically forest fires in Northern Ontario). For additional information please refer to the Aboriginal Peoples Reference Guide National Household Survey (NHS) 2011.,,,,,,,,
58,,'Multiple Aboriginal identities' includes persons who reported being any two or all three of the following: First Nations (North American Indian) Métis or Inuk (Inuit).,,,,,,,,
59,,'Aboriginal identities not included elsewhere' includes persons who did not report being First Nations (North American Indian) Métis or Inuk (Inuit) but who did report Registered or Treaty Indian status and/or membership in a First Nation or Indian band.,,,,,,,,
60,,Registered or Treaty Indian status refers to whether or not a person reported being a Registered or Treaty Indian.' Registered or Treaty Indian' includes persons who reported being a Registered or Treaty Indian in Question 20. Registered Indians are persons who are registered under the Indian Act of Canada. Treaty Indians are persons who belong to a First Nation or Indian band that signed a treaty with the Crown. Registered or Treaty Indians are sometimes also called Status Indians.,,,,,,,,
61,,This is a total population estimate. The sum of the ancestries in this table is greater than the total population estimate because a person may report more than one ancestry (ethnic origin) in the National Household Survey.,,,,,,,,
62,,'Aboriginal ancestry' includes persons who reported one or more than one of First Nations (North American Indian) Métis or Inuit ancestry in Question 17 either with or without also reporting a non-Aboriginal ancestry.  The sum of the categories 'First Nations (North American Indian) ancestry' 'Métis ancestry' and 'Inuit ancestry' is thus greater than the sum of the total for 'Aboriginal ancestry' because persons who reported more than one Aboriginal ancestry are included in the response category for each Aboriginal ancestry they reported. All respondents with Aboriginal ancestry are counted in at least one of the categories 'First Nations (North American Indian) ancestry' 'Métis ancestry' and 'Inuit ancestry' and also in the category 'Aboriginal ancestry.' Aboriginal peoples of Canada are defined in the Constitution Act 1982 section 35 (2) as including the Indian Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada. Ancestry refers to the ethnic or cultural origins of the respondent's ancestors an ancestor being usually more distant than a grandparent. A person can have more than one ethnic or cultural origin.,,,,,,,,
63,,'Non-Aboriginal ancestry only' includes persons who did not report First Nations (North American Indian) Métis or Inuit ancestry in Question 17.,,,,,,,,
64,,Refers to languages other than English or French in which the respondent can conduct a conversation. The category 'Non-official languages spoken' represents the sum of single language responses and multiple language responses received in the National Household Survey. Hence this total is greater than the total population.,,,,,,,,

Capital gains are excluded because they are not by their nature regular and recurring. It is further assumed that they are less likely to be fully spent in the period in which they are received unlike income that is regular and recurring.

Median income of economic families - The median income of a specified group of families is that amount which divides their income size distribution ranked by size of income into two halves. That is the incomes of the first half of the families are below the median while those of the second half are above the median. Median incomes of families are normally calculated for all units in the specified group whether or not they reported income. Average income of economic families - Average income of economic families refers to the weighted mean total income of families in 2010. Average income is calculated from unrounded data by dividing the aggregate income of a specified group of families (for example husband-wife families with working wives) by the number of families in that group whether or not they reported income. The above concept and procedures also apply in the calculation of these statistics on the after-tax income of economic families.

After-tax income - Refers to total income from all sources minus federal provincial and territorial income taxes paid for 2010. Median income of persons not in economic families - The median income of a specified group of persons not in economic families (for example males aged 55 to 64) is that amount which divides their income size distribution ranked by size of income into two halves. That is the incomes of the first half of the persons are below the median while those of the second half are above the median. Median incomes of persons not in economic families are normally calculated for all units in the specified group whether or not they reported income. Average income of persons not in economic families - Average income of persons not in economic families refers to the weighted mean total income of the persons not in economic families in 2010.

148,,Adjusted after-tax income for economic families and persons not in economic families - For economic family members this refers to economic family after-tax income that has been adjusted by a factor that accounts for family size. The adjustment factor takes into account the lower relative needs of additional family members as compared to a single person living alone. For use with the NHS income data the adjusted after-tax income is computed as the economic family after-tax income divided by the square root of family size. For persons not in economic families the adjusted after-tax income is set at after-tax income. This is equivalent to a factor of 1.0 for a person not in an economic family. Decile of adjusted after-tax family income - The deciles divide the population ranked by size of adjusted after-tax family income into 10 groups of equal size. The population in the bottom decile is the one who falls in the lower 10 percent of the adjusted after-tax family income distribution. The population in the top decile is the one who falls in the highest ten percent of the adjusted after-tax family income distribution. The 10 groups were formed with the full population in private households of Canada whether or not they reported income.,,,,,,,,

153,,Income status can be measured in several different ways in household surveys. For the standard products of the National Household Survey the line chosen is a relative measure: the after-tax low-income measure (LIM-AT). For this measure the income used is after-tax income of households. There are no regional variations to account for prices or cost of living differences: all applicable households in Canada face the same line adjusted for household size. This line is set at half the median of adjusted household after-tax income. To account for potential economies of scale the income of households with more than one member is divided by the square root of the size of the household.  All household members are considered to share the household income and are attributed the same income status.  Note: Low-income estimates in the 2011 National Household Survey. For the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS) low-income statistics are presented based on the after-tax low-income measure (LIM-AT). This measure is not related to the low-income cut-offs (LICO) presented in the 2006 Census and prevalence rates are conceptually not comparable. Because of the sensitivity of certain income indicators to differences in methodology and response patterns direct comparisons to establish trends with low-income estimates from other household surveys administrative programs or the 2006 Census are discouraged. The prevalence rates observed in the NHS at the national level are generally 1 to 2 percentage points higher than seen for similar concepts in other programs. However analysis of the NHS data suggests that it is valid to compare low-income data for different sub-populations within the NHS (i.e. for different geographic areas or demographic groups).
